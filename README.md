# fastaTransformer
A script written for my previous company where operational teams met some issues with transforming fasta data to the required data format

The paths are deleted on purpose for corporate privacy, so the script wouldn't run in this state.

The script expects a specific excels file format and fasta file.

It was implemented in a jupyter notebook context where it was part of a pipeline used to gather, extract, transform and wrangle data to send results taking part.
in the main French National COVID tracking initiative: EMERGEN.

The mentioned notebook had to stay private for corporate reasons but can be shared on-demand for professional inquiries.
